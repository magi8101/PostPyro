## [1.0.0] - 2025-10-03

### ðŸŽ‰ First Production Release!

### Added

- **Production-ready PostgreSQL driver** built with Rust + PyO3 + tokio-postgres
- **Complete parameter system** supporting all PostgreSQL types:
  - Strings, integers, floats, booleans
  - Automatic type conversion with binary protocol
  - Proper NULL handling and type casting
- **Full DB-API 2.0 compliance** with threadsafety level 2
- **Transaction support** with automatic commit/rollback
- **Error handling** with detailed PostgreSQL error mapping
- **Performance optimizations**:
  - LRU statement caching for prepared statements
  - Binary protocol communication
  - Zero-copy operations where possible

### Performance
